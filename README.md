* In marketing, we have the concept of a purchase funnel. There are different stages within the funnel that describe customer interactions. A basic purchase funnel includes the following steps:

  - Acquisition involves building awareness and acquiring user interest
  - Behavior is when users engage with your business
  - Conversion is when a user becomes a customer and transacts with your business

* Google Analytics groups user activity into a period of time called a “session.” A session begins when a user navigates to a page that includes the Google Analytics tracking code. A session ends after 30 minutes of inactivity. If the user returns to a page after a session ends, a new session will begin.

* When you set up your configuration, don’t exclude any data you think you might want to analyze later. Because once Analytics processes the data, it’s stored in a database where it can’t be changed.

* Analytics supports regular expressions so you can create more flexible definitions for things like view filters, goals, segments, audiences, content groups, and channel groupings. Make regex according to [this syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).

* Tracking code collects informations like the language the browser is set to, the type of browser, the device and operating system used to access the Google Store and even the traffic source.
